# hello internet, I'm Derek. 
## Product Designer, who firmly believes you can't own too many Adidas sneakers
## For the past 8 years, I've helped teams build & deliver web & mobile products to their users. I care about research, accessibility, and design systems.

## Well since you're still here, I'll tell you more about Derek, the human. 
## My journey into the digital product space started on Neopets, yes, the web game where I collected many'o'bloons. Neopets was the catalyst to learning about HTML/CSS and the rest is history. I studied Computer Science, and very quickly transitioned out of writing code into the UX world, because who doesn't love uncovering problems. 

## Outside of my professional life I enjoy spending time riding my bike, trying to write code, and playing fu√üball. I spent 10 years coaching youth soccer, and use what I learned coaching and playing to help teams at work collaborate more efficiently. After all, we all want to succeed.
