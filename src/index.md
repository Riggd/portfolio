# What's up? I'm Derek, an Indianapolis-based Product Designer
## before you ask... there is no such thing as too many Adidas sneakers
## For the past 8 years, I've worked with in-house & agency design teams to deliver hypothesis-driven design work. I use my experience to turn ideas into outcomes. Lately, I've been riding my bike to stay sane, reading about design system adoption, governance, and education, and writing terrible code (hopefully that's not why you're here).

### it's time for you to choose your adventure
