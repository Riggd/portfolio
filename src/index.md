<!-- Portfolios should highlight challenges you faced, how you collaborated with others, what you learned, and the personal/business/end-user impact of your work. -->

## Hello internet. I’m Derek, and no… I don’t have too many Adidas sneakers.

I help founders and enterprises turn their ideas into outcomes. I’ve worked with mid-size in-house design teams, as well as in an agency,  where I’ve helped build and implement product features and design systems.

### That’s great Derek, but what makes you unique?
- I like to collaborate (no gatekeeping here)
- I “talk-the-talk” with engineers (I dabble in code, though not at production-level) 
- Hypotheses drive my process (we start with an educated guess on the outcome, and use it to drive decisions)
- I’m a firm believer in function > form

My work is research informed
Understood and solve real problems for people
Drive outcomes for businesses

### But why does all of that matter…
The worst thing for a business is to build the wrong thing, or attack the wrong problem. I enjoy working alongside engineering and product to understand what outcomes we want to achieve, uncover the real problems, and translate them into tangible design work and direction for development teams.
