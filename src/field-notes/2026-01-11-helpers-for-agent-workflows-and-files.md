Written for Claude Code, need to test it out for Gemini. Should help with decision making before writing any code. WILL use more tokens.

Paste at the bottom of a prompt or workflow file:
```
- Serena for semantic code retrieval and editing tools
- Context7 for up-to-date documentation on third-party code
- Sequential Thinking for any decision-making
- Ultrathink (part of Claude's extended thinking model)
```
