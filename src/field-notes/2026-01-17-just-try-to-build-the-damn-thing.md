It's time to continue learning...

_Enter Figma MCP_

I recently ran some tests to check if there's potential to remove the abiguity of designs needing to read code or engineers needing to be experts inspecting design in figma. Here's what I learned works well:

- auditing variables in use
- checking for text updates
- ensuring spacing decisions aren't left to the "eye"

There's more to learn, but so far I'm hopeful. Cheers!
