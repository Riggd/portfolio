# Hey there, I'm Derek
### Product designer and researcher based in Indianapolis, IN. I enjoy designing delightful and accessible experiences on the internet. 
### Previously, I was a Product Designer & Product Manager at <a href="https://innovatemap.com" target="_blank">Innovatemap</a>, helping pre-seed through Series B founders with product strategy and design to get from 0 to 1.  Prior to that, I was a Lead Designer at <a href="https://carebridgehealth.com/" target="_blank">CareBridge</a>, responsible for delivering mobile apps for home health services.
### I spend my time outside of work riding my bike and playing Fußball (the one with your feet). Auf gehts Schalke!



### That’s great Derek, but what makes you unique?
- I like to collaborate (no gatekeeping here)
- I “talk-the-talk” with engineers (I dabble in code, though not at production-level) 
- Hypotheses drive my process (we start with an educated guess on the outcome, and use it to drive decisions)
- I’m a firm believer in function > form

My work is research informed
Understood and solve real problems for people
Drive outcomes for businesses

## But why does all of that matter…
The worst thing for a business is to build the wrong thing, or attack the wrong problem. I enjoy working alongside engineering and product to understand what outcomes we want to achieve, uncover the real problems, and translate them into tangible design work and direction for development teams.
