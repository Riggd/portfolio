        <h2>
            I'm a product designer with 9 years of experience driving business outcomes through design, both within startups and large organizations. My expertise lies in transforming complex problems into intuitive, accessible, and engaging user experiences. I advocate for research and data to drive product strategy. With a background in computer science and a collaborative approach honed through soccer coaching, I work seamlessly alongside product and engineering teams to deliver exceptional results.

            Outside of work, I'm an avid soccer player, concertgoer, and sneaker enthusiast (my current favorites are inspired by Wes Anderson's The Life Aquatic). I also enjoy coding to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies â€“ check out what I've used to build this site below.
