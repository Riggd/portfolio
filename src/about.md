## Hey there! I'm Derek Onay, a product designer working remotely in Indianapolis.
<!-- My journey into the digital product space started on Neopets, yes, the web game where I collected many'o'bloons. Neopets was the catalyst to learning about HTML/CSS and the rest is history. I studied Computer Science, and very quickly transitioned out of writing code into the UX world, because I love solving problems that improve people's everyday lives. -->

I've spent the last 9 years as a product designer, and occasionally a product manager to help companies drive impact to their business. Having worked in both large organizations and small startups, I distill complex problems into simple design solutions that are accessible and engaging to use. 

I use my background in computer science and coaching soccer to partner with product teams to drive real outcomes together. Doing something alone is impressive, but with a team? Man, that's what makes it fun as well! 

I spend my free time playing soccer, attending concerts with my partner, and have an obsession with my adidas sneakers. My current favorite are a nod to Wes Anderson's film, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. I still write some code here and there to keep me sharp, check below for what I'm using to build this site.
