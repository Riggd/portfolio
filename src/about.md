        <b>Hey there! I'm Derek Onay, a product designer working remotely in Indianapolis.</b>
        <p>
            I've spent the last 9 years as a product designer, and occasionally a product manager to help companies drive impact to their business. Having worked in both large organizations and small startups, I distill complex problems into simple design solutions that are accessible and engaging to use. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I use my background in computer science and coaching soccer to partner with product teams to drive real outcomes together. Doing something alone is impressive, but with a team? Man, that's what makes it fun as well! 
        </p>
        <p>
            I spend my free time playing soccer, attending concerts with my partner, and have an obsession with my adidas sneakers. My current favorite are a nod to Wes Anderson's film, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. I still write some code here and there to keep me sharp, check below for what I'm using to build this site.
