# Hey there, I'm Derek
### Product designer and researcher based in Indianapolis, IN. I enjoy designing delightful and accessible experiences on the internet. 
### Previously, I was a Product Designer & Product Manager at <a href="https://innovatemap.com" target="_blank">Innovatemap</a>, helping pre-seed through Series B founders with product strategy and design to get from 0 to 1.  Prior to that, I was a Lead Designer at <a href="https://carebridgehealth.com/" target="_blank">CareBridge</a>, responsible for delivering mobile apps for home health services.
### I spend my time outside of work riding my bike and playing Fu√üball (the one with your feet). Auf gehts Schalke!
