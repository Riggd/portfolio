        <b>Hey there! I'm Derek Onay, a product designer working remotely in Indianapolis.</b>
        <p>
            I've spent the last 9 years as a product designer and product manager to help companies drive outcomes to their business. Having worked in both small startups and large orgs, I distill complex problems into design solutions that are clear, accessible, and engaging. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My background in computer science and soccer coaching, allow me to collaborate seamlessly with product and engineering teams. Doing something alone is impressive, but with a team? Man, that's what makes it fun! 
        </p>
        <p>
            I spend my free time playing soccer, attending concerts with my partner, and obsessing over which pair of adidas sneakers I'll be buying next. My current favorite are a nod to Wes Anderson's film, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. I write some code here and there to keep me sharp, check below for what I'm using to build this site.
