# Hey there, I'm Derek
### Product designer and researcher based in Indianapolis, IN. I enjoy designing delightful and accessible experiences on the internet. 
### Previously, I was a Product Designer & Product Manager at <a href="https://innovatemap.com" target="_blank">Innovatemap</a>, helping pre-seed through Series B founders with product strategy and design to get from 0 to 1.  Prior to that, I was a Lead Designer at <a href="https://carebridgehealth.com/" target="_blank">CareBridge</a>, responsible for delivering mobile apps for home health services.

## Well since you're still here, I'll tell you more about Derek, the human. 
## My journey into the digital product space started on Neopets, yes, the web game where I collected many'o'bloons. Neopets was the catalyst to learning about HTML/CSS and the rest is history. I studied Computer Science, and very quickly transitioned out of writing code into the UX world, because who doesn't love uncovering problems. 

## Outside of my professional life I enjoy spending time riding my bike, trying to write code, and playing fußball. I spent 10 years coaching youth soccer, and use what I learned coaching and playing to help teams at work collaborate more efficiently. After all, we all want to succeed.

### I spend my time outside of work riding my bike and playing Fußball (the one with your feet). Auf gehts Schalke!
