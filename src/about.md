# Hey there! I'm Derek Onay, a product designer working remotely in Indianapolis.
My journey into the digital product space started on Neopets, yes, the web game where I collected many'o'bloons. Neopets was the catalyst to learning about HTML/CSS and the rest is history. I studied Computer Science, and very quickly transitioned out of writing code into the UX world, because I love solving problems that improve people's everyday lives.

Professionally, I've spent the last 9 years working as both a Product Designer and occasionally a product manager to help companies drive impact to their business with elegant and accessible design solutions. I've recently been interested in design systems and governance to help businesses save money and deliver products to people quicker. My background is in computer science which makes me a great ally and partner to all engineering teams. As a self-proclaimed tinkerer I still write some code here and there, check below for what I'm using to build this site.

Personally, I spend my downtime riding my bike through downtown, playing and coaching Fußball (Auf gehts Schalke!), and attending concerts with my partner, Shannon. I love my adidas trainers, and try to find unique pairs which usually means purchasing from Europe. My current favorite is a nod to Wes Anderson's film, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. When I'm not working I visit my family in Southern Germany, and trying my best to find the best Döner in Radolfzell am Bodensee.

## How it's made
This site was probably over engineered, because I like to tinker and learn new things while I'm at it.
