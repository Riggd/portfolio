- relearning web development with goals to release two products by the end of the year.

- reading about building sustainable products on the web. No more bloated sites in 2024! 

- attempting to get my portfolio site on the [512kb.club](https://512kb.club/) and reduce its carbon footprint without sacrificing the experience. Who knows? Maybe I'll write about how I did it once we're there. 

- back to playing sport after an 8 month break due to injury- Let me tell you... I'm elated!

- preparing for a year of travel. Next up: Glacier National Park
