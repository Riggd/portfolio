*Updated {% convertTime page.date %}*

I'm relearning web development. I have a goal to release two products using the figma API by the end of the year, one app and one plugin.

I've been reading about building sustainable products on the web. No more bloated sites in 2024! I want to get my site on the [512kb.club](https://512kb.club/) without sacrificing the experience. Ideally get this site to have the smallest carbon footprint I can. Who knows? Maybe I'll write how I did it once we get there. 

After an 8 month break due to injury, I'm finally back to playing soccer. And let me tell you... I'm elated!

And lastly, I'm getting excited for my trip to Glacier National Park.
