This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), a project/idea by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff). As my life changes, so will this page... I hope.

Most importantly, I'm back to playing soccer after an 8 month break due to injury. I'll tell you what, I'm stoked!

We're preparing for a year of travel. Glacier National Park is next on the list!

I'm relearning how to develop. Designers don't need to know how to code, but I find it interesting I am learning NodeJS and React at the moment. My goal is to release two products by the end of the year. My brain hurts, but we are learning so I guess that's a good thing.

I'm reading about building sustainable products on the web. No more bloated sites in 2024! 

I'm attempting to get my this site on the [512kb.club](https://512kb.club/), and reduce its carbon footprint without sacrificing the experience. Who knows? Maybe I'll write about how I did it once we're there.
