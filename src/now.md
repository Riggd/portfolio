Derek, what's this about? This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), a project/idea by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff).

Last update on {% convertTime page.date %}, as my life changes, so will this page... I hope. 

I'm relearning Node.js, React, and how to better build the designs that I create for engineers. My goal is to release two products by the end of the year. My brain hurts, but we are learning so I guess that's a good thing.

I'm reading about building sustainable products on the web. No more bloated sites in 2024! 

I'm attempting to get my portfolio site on the [512kb.club](https://512kb.club/) and reduce its carbon footprint without sacrificing the experience. Who knows? Maybe I'll write about how I did it once we're there. 

I'm back to playing sport after an 8 month break due to injury- Let me tell you... I'm elated!

We're preparing for a year of travel. Glacier National Park is next on the list!
