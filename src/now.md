<small>*Updated {% convertTime page.date %}*</small>

I'm relearning web development. I have a goal to release two products using the figma API by the end of the year, one app and one plugin.

I've been reading about building sustainable products on the web. No more bloated sites in 2024! I want to get my portfolio site on the [512kb.club](https://512kb.club/) and reduce its carbon footprint without sacrificing the experience. Who knows? Maybe I'll write about how I did it once we're there. 

After an 8 month break due to injury, I'm finally back to playing soccer. And let me tell you... I'm elated!

And lastly, I'm getting excited for my trip to Glacier National Park.
