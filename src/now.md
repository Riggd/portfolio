<h1 style="font-size:4rem; font-weight: 600; margin: 35vh 0 0 0;">What I'm doing /now</h1>

- relearning web development with goals to release two products by the end of the year.

- reading about building sustainable products on the web. No more bloated sites in 2024! 

- attempting to get my portfolio site on the [512kb.club](https://512kb.club/) and reduce its carbon footprint without sacrificing the experience. Who knows? Maybe I'll write about how I did it once we're there. 

- back to playing sport after an 8 month break due to injury- Let me tell you... I'm elated!

- preparing for a year of travel. Next up: Glacier National Park

As my life changes, so will this page... I hope. Last update on {% convertTime page.date %}
