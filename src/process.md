## Questions that lead to collaboration, hypotheses, and measurable outcomes.

#### 1. Why are we building?

- Analyze existing data (analytics, user feedback) to pinpoint the core problem

- I lead workshops & ideation sessions to uncover the "real" problems

- Formulate a clear hypothesis stating the expected impact of any change

#### 2. What are we building?

- I start broad, ideating on potential solutions aligning with engineering and product teams to understand technical and business constraints

- Every first idea needs refinement, we iterate together to ensure 

- Validate design solutions. I will help you find the right amount of validation to seek, regardless of time constraints

#### 3. How are we building & measuring success?

- I'm an engineers best-friend, my background in engineering allows me to collaborate seamlessly with teams to build design with an impact

- We measure the impact of the final design against the initial hypothesis

- Iterate and improve based on user feedback and business metrics
