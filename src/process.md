## I'm a big believer that everyone working on the team has something to bring to the table to create a great product. 

I take an **understanding-first** approach to product design. Understanding dictates diving deep into the root-cause and problem we are attmepting to solve through design. My goal with product design is to have the tough conversations up front to help companies avoid spending time and money building the wrong thing.

### That's great Derek, but what does that mean?

I collaborate with product and engineering through out the entire product development lifecycle to ensure companies are building the best solution to any problem they are having. Defining contstraints early, testing often, and sharing knowledge is key to any successful product. 

When time allows, I'm a firm believer in beginning with generative research to further uncover exactly what users may be experiencing, not just what they say. While generative research can be helpful, sometimes you want to move fast and that means finding other ways to test solutions. My job as a product designer is not to slow things down, but rather ensure a solution will meet the needs of a user while supporting business objectives and KPIs. The first idea is rarely the best solution; however, iterating and testing along the way ensures that we are working towards solutions that users will love!

If this methodology sounds compelling to you, let's build something together!
