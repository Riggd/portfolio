### Problem
The existing Twitch extension ([Link to Extension](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/extensions/7n05t3351hle0tx07a4uejyjmk8aay-1.4.6)) did not support all bracket types, and was unable to be used as a tool to drive additional marketing and sponsorship placements across the erena ecosystem.

### Goal
Redesign the extension to support all bracket types.

### Outcome
