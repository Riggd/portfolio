### Problem
The existing Twitch extension ([Link to Extension](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/extensions/7n05t3351hle0tx07a4uejyjmk8aay-1.4.6)) did not support all bracket types, and was unable to be used as a tool to drive more user engagment to marketing and sponsorship placements across the erena ecosystem. 

### Goal
Increase engagement from fans and enthusiats viewing events hosted by eFuse or influencers participating in events. Improve the look and feel of the twitch extension to support all bracket types (Round Robin, Double/Single Elimination, Swiss, and Point Race), and provide additional sponsorship placements within the extension.
