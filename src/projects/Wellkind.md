roles: 
- Product Design Lead
team: 
    - Spencer Abrams, Product Manager
    - Parker McCullough, Brand Design
    - Kaylee Green, Brand Design
    - Yharlei Chamboneth, Motion Design
    - EIG, Engineering Firm
duration: June 2022 - December 2022
wins: 
    - VMS Biomarketing won an award in the PM360 publication for innovation in the App Category
    - Bringing Wellkind to market would reduce nurse engagement calls for simple questions by ~20% in a year 
issues:
    - Starting brand and motion design prior to product design would've reduced the total time it took to get the product live  
    - We could've spent more time prioritizing which features were "must-have" for patients. Ultimately they just want the best care, the app shouldn't slow that down.

## Problem

- Roughly 60% of patients delaying start or abandon treatment altogether

- Nurses receive many phone calls for questions related to dosage and appointments, leaving less time for patients needing additional help an care

- Nursing staff is expensive and difficult to hire to support growing products & patient counts

> "Today’s patients are looking for a centralized place to access support to manage their chronic disease therapy, coordination between all the support services that are provided by pharma companies and easy-to-navigate self-serve tools that are personalized to them,” said Mike Young, Chief Technology Officer at VMS BioMarketing."

## Goal
VMS wanted the product to:

- Educate patients about their condition or illness

- Teach patients about their treatment plan, so they're aware of benefits

- Create long-term relationships with patients to engage them on their wellness journey

- Help scale the current system of nurse-only support, freeing nurses to have more meaningful patient interactions

## The Users
The Wellkind app is built for patients, but interacts directly with the nurses journey.  The app supports two personas:

Patients with chronic condition

- Day-to-day lives have been changed

- The products are extremely expensive

- Their relationship with the product/manufacturer is non-existent

Nurses supporting patient care

- Want to help patients have better days

- Love helping all patients, but prefer the complex interactions vs simple

## The Wellkind Design System
In order to speed up development time to get the mobile app to market, I designed a simple design system that could be followed to extend the solutions past the initial design work. Additionally the creation of a base design system allows any future designers to pick up and reference similar patterns and standards which was a request of VMS Biomarketing.

This included:
- Tokenizing all type, color, and text styles for easy handoff between design & development

- Establishing standards for forms, modals, confirmation and interactions across the mobile app

- Providing motion and brand standards to translate any marketing assets into product

## Outcomes
Over the course of 6 months, we delivered a mobile application and partnered with EIG to ensure the designs were translated into a fully functional mobile application that could be delivered to VMS BioMarketing. I was in charge of all product design decisions and received support from the brand & motion designers on the project who provided a brand guide with usage guidelines for newly created assets. 

The true impact of our work on Wellkind will begin in 2023 as VMS BioMarketing expects to engage over 25,000 unique patients throughout 2023.

>“Bringing Wellkind to market is another monumental step towards providing the bio-pharma industry a differentiated way to engage with patients and medication adherence,” said Mike Young, CTO. “Wellkind is a patient’s one-stop shop, delivering an experience that is personalized to each patient.”

The Wellkind app was selected to be featured in the [2022 Innovation Issue for PM360](https://www.pm360online.com/pm360-2022-innovative-product-wellkind-from-vms-biomarketing/) in the product category, a pharma trade publication that highlights the latest and biggest innovations across marketing, commercialization, R&D and more.
