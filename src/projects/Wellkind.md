### Problem
VMS Biomarketing wanted to supplement their nurse-to-patient engagement process with a modern mobile solution to reduce nurses time spent on phone for simple issues the patient was facing. Nurses were receiving a high volume of questions regarding dosage and product usage questions that were taking time away from questions that requried more nurse input.

### Goal
Design a mobile app to change the way people experience the drug and wellness industry by connecting patients and companies in a meaningful way. VMS wanted to engage, inspire and motivate people to invest in their personal wellness by starting and continuing treatment.

VMS wanted the product to:
- Educate patients about their disease or illness so they want to continue treatment.

- Teach patients about their treatment plan so they understand the risks and benefits.

- Create long-term relationships with patients to engage them on their wellness journeys.

- Help scale the current system of nurse-only support, freeing nurses to have more meaningful patient interactions.


### Outcomes
Over the course of 6 months, we delivered a mobile application and partened with EIG to ensure the designs were translated into a fully functional mobile application that could be delivered to VMS BioMarketing. I was in charge of all product design decisions and received support from the brand & motion designers on the project who provided a brand guide with usage guidelines for newly created assets. 

The true impact of our engagement will be felt by patients for years to come, as VMS BioMarketing expects to engage over 25,000 unique patients using Wellkind throughout 2023.

“Bringing Wellkind to market is another monumental step towards providing the biopharma industry a differentiated way to engage with patients and medication adherence,” said Mike Young, CTO. “Wellkind is a patient’s one-stop shop, delivering an experience that is personalized to each patient.”

The Wellkind app was selected to be featured in the [2022 Innovation Issue for PM360](https://www.pm360online.com/pm360-2022-innovative-product-wellkind-from-vms-biomarketing/) in the product category, a pharma trade publication that highlights the latest and biggest innovations across marketing, commercialization, R&D and more.
