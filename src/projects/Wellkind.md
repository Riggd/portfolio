duration: June 2022 - December 2022
wins: 
    - VMS Biomarketing won an award in the PM360 publication for innovation in the App Category
    - Bringing Wellkind to market would reduce nurse engagement calls for simple questions by ~20% in a year 
issues:
    - Starting brand and motion design prior to product design would've reduced the total time it took to get the product live  
    - We could've spent more time prioritizing which features were "must-have" for patients. Ultimately they just want the best care, the app shouldn't slow that down.

### Overview
VMS BioMarketing, the leading provider of patient engagement & adherence solutions, contracted with our Innovatemap team to deliver a best-in-class mobile app to improve a patients experience on this new journey in their lives.
<br/><br/>

### Patient problems that drove my decision-making
- Patients struggle to find and trust information about their drug

- 60% of patients delay start or abandon treatment, because drugs are expensive

- Patient engagement calls are often for dosage and appointments, leaving less time for patients needing immediate care

- Nursing staff is asked to do more with less, as product and patient counts grow

### Our Hypothesis 
If we can educate, teach, and create long-term relationships between a patient and their wellness journey, then more patients are likely to start treatment
</section>

<!-- <section>
The product manager and I led an MVP workshop to identify what VMSâ€™s product strategy and goals were for the product.  With users and outcomes at the center of all decision-making, we identified and prioritized the features that will add the most value. Our output, a Solution Overview, focused on establishing a clear direction for the MVP and roadmap for our upcoming design work.

*Prioritizing features that will benefit patients*

I designed product screens to support development as VMS brings the product to life, including concepts for onboarding, navigation, and consistent page structure. While in an ideal case, we'd have access to patients to test our solution, we used the VMS internal team and nurses on staff to advocate for the patients, be proactive about potential UX errors, provide guidance and ensure production was true to the vision.
