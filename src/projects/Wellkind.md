duration: June 2022 - December 2022
wins: 
    - VMS Biomarketing won an award in the PM360 publication for innovation in the App Category
    - Bringing Wellkind to market would reduce nurse engagement calls for simple questions by ~20% in a year 
issues:
    - Starting brand and motion design prior to product design would've reduced the total time it took to get the product live  
    - We could've spent more time prioritizing which features were "must-have" for patients. Ultimately they just want the best care, the app shouldn't slow that down.

### Patients diagnosed with chronic conditions, know their lives are about to change. But what can they do to ensure they receive adequate care when accurate information is few and far between, and nursing staff is spread thin?

VMS BioMarketing, the leading provider of patient engagement & adherence solutions, understands these patient problems and to deliver a mobile solution to support their patients while driving outcomes for Pharma. They contracted with our Innovatemap team to deliver a best-in-class mobile app to improve a patients experience on this new journey in their lives.

## I led product design efforts alongside the Innovatemap team to deliver:

- 25k patients successfully onboarded in year one

- A 15% reduction in nurse engagement calls for "simple" drug related questions -->

> Today’s patients are looking for a centralized place to access support to manage their chronic disease therapy, coordination between all the support services that are provided by pharma companies and easy-to-navigate self-serve tools that are personalized to them.”  Mike Young, Chief Technology Officer at VMS BioMarketing

## VMS BioMarketing's Big Problem

- Drugs are expensive which means roughly 60% of patients delaying start or abandon treatment altogether

- Patient engagement calls are often for dosage and appointments, leaving less time for patients needing immediate care

- Nursing staff is asked to do more with less as products grow and patient counts grow

## Insert Wellkind, a mobile solution to improve patients relationship with their drug
![Solution Overview](/assets/projects/wellkind/so.png){.wk-so data-zoomable}
*Solution Overview for Wellkind*

First, the Product Manager and I led an MVP workshop to hone in on VMS’s product strategy and goals for the product.

Then, we established a clear direction for the MVP. With users and outcomes at the center of all decision-making, we identified and prioritized the features that will add the most value. 

Next, I designed product screens to support development as VMS brings the product to life, including concepts for onboarding, navigation, and consistent page structure. While in an ideal case, we'd have access to patients to test our solution, we used the VMS internal team and nurses on staff to advocate for the patients, be proactive about potential UX errors, provide guidance and ensure production was true to the vision. 

### We came to an agreement that we needed to focus on the following functionality:

- Educate patients about their condition or illness

- Teach patients about their treatment plan, so they're aware of benefits

- Create long-term relationships with patients to engage them on their wellness journey

- Help scale the current system of nurse-only support, freeing nurses to have more meaningful patient interactions

## The impact Wellkind had
Over the course of 6 months, we delivered a mobile application and partnered with EIG to ensure the designs were translated into a fully functional mobile application that could be delivered to VMS BioMarketing. I was in charge of all product design decisions and received support from the brand & motion designers on the project who provided a brand guide with usage guidelines for newly created assets. 

The true impact of our work on Wellkind will begin in 2023 as VMS BioMarketing expects to engage over 25,000 unique patients throughout 2023.

>Bringing Wellkind to market is another monumental step towards providing the bio-pharma industry a differentiated way to engage with patients and medication adherence. Wellkind is a patient’s one-stop shop, delivering an experience that is personalized to each patient. Mike Young, CTO

The Wellkind app was selected to be featured in the [2022 Innovation Issue for PM360](https://www.pm360online.com/pm360-2022-innovative-product-wellkind-from-vms-biomarketing/) in the product category, a pharma trade publication that highlights the latest and biggest innovations across marketing, commercialization, R&D and more.

<!-- ## The Wellkind Design System
In order to speed up development time to get the mobile app to market, I designed a simple design system that could be followed to extend the solutions past the initial design work. Additionally the creation of a base design system allows any future designers to pick up and reference similar patterns and standards which was a request of VMS Biomarketing.

This included:
- Tokenizing all type, color, and text styles for easy handoff between design & development

- Establishing standards for forms, modals, confirmation and interactions across the mobile app

- Working with EIG, development agency, to build out a system to help extend the project after our engagement alongside the VMS team
