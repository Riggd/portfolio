roles: 
- Product Design Lead
team: 
    - Spencer Abrams, PM
    - Parker McCullough, Brand
    - Kaylee Green, Brand
    - Yharlei Chamboneth, Motion
    - EIG, Engineering Firm
duration: June 2022 - December 2022
wins: 
    - VMS Biomarketing won an award in the PM360 publication for innovation in the App Category
    - Bringing Wellkind to market would reduce nurse engagement calls for simple questions by ~20% in a year 
issues:
    - Starting brand and motion design prior to product design would've reduced the total time it took to get the product live  
    - We could've spent more time prioritizing which features were "must-have" for patients. Ultimately they just want the best care, the app shouldn't slow that down.

#### Overview
### VMS BioMarketing, the leading provider of patient engagement & adherence solutions, contracted with our Innovatemap team to deliver a best-in-class mobile app to improve a patients experience on this new journey in their lives.

### A problem for patients
- Patients struggle to find and trust information about their drug

- 60% of patients delay start or abandon treatment, because drugs are expensive

- Patient engagement calls are often for dosage and appointments, leaving less time for patients needing immediate care

- Nursing staff is asked to do more with less, as product and patient counts grow

> Today’s patients are looking for a centralized place to access support to manage their chronic disease therapy, coordination between all the support services that are provided by pharma companies and easy-to-navigate self-serve tools that are personalized to them.”  Mike Young, Chief Technology Officer at VMS BioMarketing -->

<section>

#### Our Hypothesis 
## If we can educate, teach, and create long-term relationships between a patient and their wellness journey, then more patients are likely to start treatment
</section>

<!-- <section>
The product manager and I led an MVP workshop to identify what VMS’s product strategy and goals were for the product.  With users and outcomes at the center of all decision-making, we identified and prioritized the features that will add the most value. Our output, a Solution Overview, focused on establishing a clear direction for the MVP and roadmap for our upcoming design work.

## Our work on Wellkind app was recognized as a 2022 most innovate products by [PM360](https://www.pm360online.com/pm360-2022-innovative-product-wellkind-from-vms-biomarketing/)

### What it means for VMW BioMarketing
- VMS BioMarketing has begun onboarding 25k patients on to the product

- reduced "simple" engagement call volume by ~5-10% freeing up more time for impactful calls with patients

<!-- By starting with what's most important, we were able to deliver the following work for VMS BioMarketing and it's patients:
- Wireframes
- Onboarding
- 
- Design System

I designed product screens to support development as VMS brings the product to life, including concepts for onboarding, navigation, and consistent page structure. While in an ideal case, we'd have access to patients to test our solution, we used the VMS internal team and nurses on staff to advocate for the patients, be proactive about potential UX errors, provide guidance and ensure production was true to the vision.  -->
