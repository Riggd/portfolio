## What I did
I most recently worked with eFuse, an eSports startup with a mission to change lives through gaming. My role was to help drive  Design System adoption, education, and governance, as well as design new features to support the eRena tournament platform. 

My role on this project had me working closely with another product designer, and engineers to transition from a Figma component library to a robust system maintained in code to save time and resources for eFuse.

The design system team was cross-functional design-led effort. All team members were responsible for product delivery in addition to work on the MOAB design system. Our biggest organization problem was design system governance, and building out designed components in our codebase.

## eFuse products:
- eRena, tournament platform

- esports.gg, gaming news platform

- mynt.gg, web3 community engagement platform

- sidekick.gg, streamer tools
</section>

## Core Problems
- Design solutions aren’t aligned across products. For example, users didn’t feel they were still engaging with an eFuse product when moving from esports.gg to eRena or mynt.gg.

- Styled components were implemented inconsistently in the code, and caused a diminished user experience

- Design reviews were spent giving feedback on visual inconsistencies vs whether or not the proper solution was in place

- Most of the MOAB design system had yet to be built into code, due to lack of resources and overarching implementation process

## Design System Structure
The MOAB design system is structured with a core foundation library, style libraries, a Web UI library, and then product-specific component libraries.

*Breakdown of the design system structure*

The decision to split Web components from product specific was to allow for custom implementations across different products that served different users and functions, while still providing consistency within the larger design style and visual language.

### Changed the design review process 
- Increased length, but lowered cadence to allow the team to dive deep into projects to ensure consistency across the four products

- Opened up dedicated time to explore and test new or updated components

- Used additional time to educate & provide documentation to designers to aid in pushing adoption within their squads  
</div>

### Design System Updates
- Built intake form for requests to add to design system backlog

- Built out Kanban board to track progress of system updates

- Worked with Marketing & Social teams to establish voice & tone guidelines

- Build out process to allow any designer to understand whether or not a new component needs to live in the system or be a part of the product-specific library
