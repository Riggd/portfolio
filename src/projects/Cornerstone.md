## No longer just reviews
After 25 years in business it was time for Angie's List to reimagine how we approach product design & development. Angie's List is no longer just a review website, our goal is to help connect you with high-quality service professionals who service where you live. It was time for the us to refocus on who you are and what problems you have. Whether you are looking to start a new project or you are in an emergency and need to hire ASAP, our team is focused on delivering quality products to meet your needs.

## Design principles leading with empathy
As a company focused on helping people love the home they live in, it was important that our own design principles shaped how we would want to be treated as homeowners or service professionals. I helped lead our design team in creating principles that we could each align/agree with to deliver best-in-class products.

### The results of our work

*At Angie's List we build products that are...*

*Empathetic (For the people)*

- Angie's List builds products for homeowners and service provider. Our designs are accessible to all, regardless of situation or ability. We stay focused on our users' problems by listening carefully, observing users in action, reducing bias in decision making.

*Clear & Efficient (Simple and progressive)*

- Angie's List reduces the tension in hiring a service provider. The products are progressive; using intelligence to provide active and passive actions to connect home owners with service providers. We make the intimidating tasks simple, so you can work smarter not harder. Current knowledge > Consistency

*Purposeful (Purposeful not just pretty)*
- Angie's List products look good, but not for the sake of being pretty. Every experience is purposefully crafted to provide the best solution to the problems that home owners face. All aesthetic decisions are meant to help to solve a problem, and should be obvious in their use in the product.

*Supportive & Trustworthy (Built with trust)*
- As a leader in the home services industry, Angie's List products should build confidence and instill trust between home owners and the service providers they are looking to hire. Our products should be helpful and supportive in connecting the home owner to a service provider. Users trust Angie's List to match them with high quality service providers without employing dark/sneaky tactics. (edited)
